# My interests

Casually interested in math and CS, and a bunch of other stuffs

# What's on my github?

Mostly random stuffs that come in my mind while learning some math/CS stuffs, aside from some side stuffs that I gave up working on.

# Where should you have a look at?
Due to my terrible ability in actually completing a project (most of them are like half way complete until I give up), the only thing that is sorta complete is the <a href="https://github.com/2192375d/ALL-NOTES">notes</a> I take using Obsidian. It includes most things I learned from April 2025 until today, the general topics include:

- probability
- introduction to computer science
- bunch of math stuffs
- side stuffs like coop notes

There's more in it but I'm too lazy to push them
